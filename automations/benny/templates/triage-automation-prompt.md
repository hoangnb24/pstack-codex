# Triage automation prompt

> Dormant prompt source. Do not create a schedule or event subscription from this template without the user explicitly requesting it. Read and apply the run gate in `.agents/automations/benny/RUN-MODES.md`; default to dry run. Verify the target runner can read the committed pack and referenced configuration.

Read and follow `.agents/automations/benny/skills/triage-issue-reports/SKILL.md` for this run.

Configuration source. Include this repository-relative path only when it is committed in the same target repository. Otherwise paraphrase the configured values. Never use a plugin source or cache path:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

A separately authorized event subscription must describe this as a new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting or writing to the issue tracker.

The committed operational file owns classification, attachment review, cause tracing, routing, dedupe, tracker writes, and the final verdict. Post no progress messages. Never post a root message in the source channel.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Any delegated worker must be read-only, return findings only, and receive an explicit ban on every Slack write action.

End the single verdict with exactly one configured marker:

```text
[benny:bug]
[benny:performance]
[benny:other]
```

A bug or performance marker may add `tracker=<URL>`.
